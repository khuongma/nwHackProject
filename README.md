* The majority of cleaning products in the United States contain harmful chemicals. Although many products pass EPA regulations, it is well known that many products still contain chemicals that can cause rashes, asthma, allergic reactions, and even cancer. It is important that the public has easy access to information of the chemicals that may be harmful to them as well as the environment.
* We had very limited experience for the idea that we have in developing an iOS app but, we wanted to challenge ourselves. The challenges the front end had were incorporating the camera feature and the text detector into a single app. As well as trying to navigate the changes between the newer version of Swift 11 from older versions. For our backend members, they had difficulties incorporating databases from Microsoft/Google, but ended up using JSON.
* Currently our project is specific to cleaning products, however in the future we would like to incorporate other products such as cosmetics, hair care, skin care, medicines, and food products. Additionally, we hope to alter the list of ingredients in a more visual way so that users can clearly understand which ingredients are more dangerous than others.
